# FAVE toolkits

This is a repository for the FAVE-Align and FAVE-extract toolkits.
The first commit here represents the toolkit as it was available on the FAVE website as of October 21, 2013.
The extractFormants code in the JoFrhwld/FAAV repository represents an earlier version of the code.

## Documentation
Current documentation for installation and usage available on the github wiki. [https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE/wiki](https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE/wiki)

## FAVE website

The interactive FAVE website hosted at the University of Pennsylvania is no longer available. The DARLA site hosted by Dartmouth can be used to run the Montreal Forced Aligner, and FAVE-extract. [http://darla.dartmouth.edu](http://darla.dartmouth.edu)

## Support

You can find user support for installing and using the FAVE toolkits at the [FAVE Users' Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fave-users).

## Contributing to FAVE
For the most part, we'll be utilizing the fork-and-pull paradigm (see [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)). Please send pull requests to the `dev` branch.

You can fill in a bug report at the [issue tab](https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE/issues)

There may be a delay between when a bug is reported and when a bug is resolved. Developers prioritize bugs based on difficulty, importance, and other factors, so bug reports are usually not handled in the order they are received.
