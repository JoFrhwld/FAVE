Installing FAVE 2
=================

Required software
-----------------

FAVE sometimes requires other software libraries in order to work. 
 * FAVE-align requires `SoX <http://sox.sourceforge.net/>`_ and `HTK <https://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/>`_.
 * FAVE-extract requires `Praat <https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/>`_.

You will need to manually install these if they are not already installed on your computer.

.. warning::
   Mac users: HTK might need slight modification before it works. See `this bug report <https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE/issues/48>`_.

Install with PIP
----------------

FAVE is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) as ``fave``. You can install it using:

.. code-block:: console

   python3 -m pip install fave

Other package managers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Work is ongoing to publish FAVE as a debian package, but no other package system is supported at the moment. If you would like to package FAVE for your system, please feel free to :doc:`contribute <../contributing>`!
